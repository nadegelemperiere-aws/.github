## DESCRIPTION

Why terraform modules ?

* ðŸª¢ Because terraform is a cool tool but a full cloud deployment may because a bit tedious to manage and evolve. Separate it into small modules is easier to manage
* ðŸ˜• Because integrating cloud services via terraform is not so easy, better be done once and for all 
* ðŸ‘½ Modules are a way to share and enforce security best practices while easing the DevOps life
